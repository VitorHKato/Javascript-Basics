## Data Types:
### Type Conversion:
- Convert a decimal number to a string.
- Convert a string containing a decimal number to a floating-point number.
### String Manipulation:
- Create a function that returns the concatenation of two strings.
- Write a function that takes a string as input and returns its length.
### Number Manipulation:
- Create a function that rounds down a floating-point number.
- Develop a function that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
### Array Manipulation:
- Create a function that adds an element to the end of an array and returns the new array.
- Write a function that removes the first element of an array and returns the new array.

## Variables, Types, Expressions and Assignments
### Variable Declaration:
- Declare a string variable to store your name.
- Declare a number variable to store your age.
- Declare a boolean variable to indicate if you are a student.
### Value Assignment:
- Assign your name to the variable name.
- Assign your age to the variable age.
- Assign true or false to the variable student.
### Data Types:
- Create variables for each of the primitive data types in JavaScript: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint.
### Arithmetic Expressions:
- Declare two variables with numbers and calculate the sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division of these numbers. Store each result in a separate variable.
### String Concatenation:
- Declare two string variables and concatenate them. Store the result in a new variable.
### String Interpolation:
- Use template literals to create a message that includes the variables name and age.
### Variable Reassignment:
- Reassign new values to the variables name, age, and student, and display the new values.
### Assignment Operators:
- Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to modify the values of the numeric variables.
