## Data Types:
### Type Conversion:
- Convert a decimal number to a string.
- Convert a string containing a decimal number to a floating-point number.
### String Manipulation:
- Create a function that returns the concatenation of two strings.
- Write a function that takes a string as input and returns its length.
### Number Manipulation:
- Create a function that rounds down a floating-point number.
- Develop a function that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
### Array Manipulation:
- Create a function that adds an element to the end of an array and returns the new array.
- Write a function that removes the first element of an array and returns the new array.

## Variables, Types, Expressions and Assignments
### Variable Declaration:
- Declare a string variable to store your name.
- Declare a number variable to store your age.
- Declare a boolean variable to indicate if you are a student.
### Value Assignment:
- Assign your name to the variable name.
- Assign your age to the variable age.
- Assign true or false to the variable student.
### Data Types:
- Create variables for each of the primitive data types in JavaScript: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint.
### Arithmetic Expressions:
- Declare two variables with numbers and calculate the sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division of these numbers. Store each result in a separate variable.
### String Concatenation:
- Declare two string variables and concatenate them. Store the result in a new variable.
### String Interpolation:
- Use template literals to create a message that includes the variables name and age.
### Variable Reassignment:
- Reassign new values to the variables name, age, and student, and display the new values.
### Assignment Operators:
- Use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to modify the values of the numeric variables.

## Standard Input and Output
### Simple Data Input:
- Ask the user for their name and display a welcome message.
### Number Input and Conversion:
- Ask the user for two numbers and display their sum.
### String Input and Manipulation:
- Ask the user for a string and display its length.
### Concatenation of Inputs:
- Ask the user for two strings and display their concatenation.
### String Interpolation with Inputs:
- Ask the user for their name and age, and display a message that includes this information using template literals.
### Mathematical Operations with Inputs:
- Ask the user for a number and display the square of that number.
### Array Input and Manipulation:
- Ask the user for a series of numbers separated by commas and display the average of those numbers.

## Logical and Arithmetic operations
- Ask the user for their age and display a message indicating whether they are of legal age (age 18 or older) or not.
- Ask the user for two numbers and display a message indicating which one is larger.
- Ask the user for a number and display a message indicating whether the number is odd or even.
- Ask the user for two boolean values (true or false) and display the result of the AND, OR, and NOT logical operations between them.
- Ask the user for two numbers and a logical operator (&& for AND, || for OR) and display the result of the logical expression.
- Ask the user for two strings and display a message indicating whether they are equal or different.

## Selection Structures
- Triangle Validation: Write a program that asks the user for three numbers representing the sides of a triangle. 
The program should check if these three numbers can form a valid triangle (the sum of any two sides must be greater than
the third side). If valid, classify the triangle as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
- Leap Year Verification: Implement a program that asks the user for a year and checks if it is a leap year. A year is a
leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.
- Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: Develop a program that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
The program should prompt the user for their choice and generate a random choice for the computer. Display who the 
winner was or if there was a tie.
